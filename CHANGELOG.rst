Unreleased
==========



[0.3.2] - 2016-07-18
====================

- Added this CHANGELOG.rst file
- Added support for patient_id_list constraint in getHighdimData
- Fix bugs in error handling, e.g. when no Content-Type is provided by the server
- implement getPatientSet
- use inTrialId as patient id: The former 'id' field of patients should not be used outside of Transmart, instead the inTrialId should be used. New versions of rest-api don't export the 'id' field anymore.
- Change from `rCurl` to `httr` to fix authentication with new Transmart servers using an updated OAuth plugin

[0.3.1] - 2016-04-06
====================

- Fix assay_id_list (erroneously was assay_ids)
- Change to getObservations output: change the class of the first column of the conceptInfo table to character
