# TranSMART R client package

This package enables R programmers to access to a tranSMART installation via its [RESTful API](https://github.com/thehyve/transmart-rest-api).
Usually this involves authentication with the tranSMART installation. The package has built-in
functionality for obtaining an authentication token.

The `protobuf` and its accompanying c implementation package need to be installed on the machine. 
The Protocol Buffers must be at version 2.2.0 or newer and can be installed either via the distribution
package manager.

Ubuntu:

    # apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libprotoc-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-c-compiler

Redhat:

    # # Incomplete, you also need libcurl and libssl development packages and maybe a protobuf-compiler devel package
    # yum install protobuf-compiler protobuf protobuf-devel
    
Or install it from source with one of the packages available at [https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list).
