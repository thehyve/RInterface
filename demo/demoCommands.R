# load package
require("transmartRClient")

# Connect to the Hyve's demo transmart instance with the connectToTransmart function.
#   You can log in as a guest user with username "user" and password "user". 
#   Occasionally, access to this demo server will be temporarily blocked when a demo is being given, in which case you cannot log in with these credentials.

#Alternatively, you can try to log in to the demo server of the transmart foundation.
#   We cannot, however, guarantee that this server will be running, that it has the right tranSMART version and which data will be present there
#   Always check what the latest adress is of the transmart demo server and if this matches with the adress filled in in the connectToTransmart function below. 
#   You can look this up at the foundation's website http://transmartfoundation.org - Go to "PLATFORM" in the menu on top of the page and

# retrieve a list of the available studies in the database:

#the clinical data is stored in three tables: 
# - an observation table with the clinical measurements
# - a subjectInfo table which contains information about the subjects/patients, such as their age or sex
# - and a table with information about the variables/concepts and where they can be 
#    found in the data tree  of tranSMART (see the panel "Navigate terms" in the "Analyze" tab of the 
#    tranSMART web app: http://transmart-demo.thehyve.net/transmart/datasetExplorer/index )
